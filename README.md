# Fractal Website

This repository contains the code for the Fractal website where users create and manage their account. It interfaces with the email-webserver, vm-webserver and admin-dashboard.

The Netlify staging version of the website is hosted at: https://fractalcomputers.netlify.com/

## Development

The admin dashboard is developed using the `npm` package manager. You can start developing by running `npm install`, and can launch into a localhost via `npm start`.

If you need to update dependencies, you can run `npm upgrade`, followed by `npm prune` to remove unnecessary dependencies.
